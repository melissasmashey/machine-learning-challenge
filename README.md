Two Python Files  with cooresponding .sav files included:

1) Logistic_Regression_Model
	Logistic_Regression_Model.sav

2) SVM_Model
	SVM_Model.sav

Comparison:

The results between the Logistic Regression and SVM model were quite similar in both training/ testing and tuning results.

Results:


MODELS				TRAINING Score		TESTING Score		GRID  Best score
	
Logistic Regression		0.837			0.833			0.877

SVM			 	 0.843		  	0.834		  	0.884

Final Conclusion: In the end, SVM performed slightly better, but both models worked well with  the data.
